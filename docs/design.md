This is going to be the main design document for the extension. This is where we will be outlining the overall architecture of the extension and how the different modules will interact with each other. This is going to be a living document that will be updated as we continue to develop the extension and as we make changes to the design. This is going to be a high level overview of the design and it will not go into too much detail about the implementation of each module. This is going to be a guide for us as we continue to develop the extension and it will help us stay on track and make sure that we are building the extension in a way that is scalable and maintainable.

NOTE: This design document is a work in progress and will be updated as we continue to develop the extension. This is just a starting point and we will be making changes to it as we go along. This is going to be a living document that will evolve as we continue to develop the extension and as we learn more about the problem that we are trying to solve.
