// This is going to be used for keyword matching, rule evaluation, and will make the detections for using. 
// some of the logic here will be based on the parsed data that we get from the parser module. 
// We will be using the parsed data to run our detection algorithms and then we will be using the results of those algorithms to make our detections.  
// In this file it will be pure logic == easy to debug == easy to explain in the final paper
